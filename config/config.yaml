# flag if counts after each processing steps (of all modalities) should be saved as CSV, which is time and storage intense options are: RAW, FILTERED, NORMALIZED, CORRECTED, if no count matrices are desired leave empty []

# names for the Seurat Assays mapped to 10X genomics features (leave empty "" if not applicable)
modality_flags:
    Antibody_Capture: "AB"
    CRISPR_Guide_Capture: "gRNA"
    Custom: "HTO"

# CRISPR UMI background treshold for gRNA assignment (gRNA counts <= crispr_umi_threshold will be set 0)

# REGEX-based metadata extension used with Seurat::PercentageFeatureSet
# every entry is a new metadata column (use Camel case eg mitoPercent, no underlines '_')
# https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/percentagefeatureset
# example: riboPercent: "^RP[SL][[:digit:]]|^RPLP[[:digit:]]|^RPSA"
percentage_regex:
    mitoPercent: "^MT-"

# eval based metadata column transformations -> eval(parse(text=" ")) -> escape \\ has to be \\\\
# every entry is a new metadata column (use Camel case eg mitoPercent, no underlines '_')
# metadata dataframe is called "metadata"
# example: condKO: "paste0(metadata$condition,'+', metadata$KOcall)"

##### MERGE #####
# no configuration necessary

##### SPLIT #####
# needs to be categorical variable in metadata
# data subsets are only generated for the indicated groups, because we are not always interested in all possible subsets eg negatives/doublets
# 'batch' denotes samples (ie sample_names from sample_annotation)
# example: replicate: ['A','B']
split_by:
    condition: ['untreated','8h_cytokines','24h_cytokines']


##### FILTER #####
# logical expression for filtering, all variables need to be in metadata (leave empty "" if not applicable)
# example: "pass_QC == 'True'"
filter_expression: "mitoPercent <= 20"

##### NORMALIZATION #####
# using SCTransform defaults https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/sctransform

# filter for genes that have been detected in at least min_cells_per_gene cells (default: 5)
min_cells_per_gene: 5

##### CELL SCORES #####
# calculated using normalized counts (ie assay="SCT", slot="data")

# perform cell cycle analysis with given gene lists of S and G2/M phase respectively using https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/cellcyclescoring
# to use markers loaded with Seurat from Tirosh et al 2015 -> put 'tirosh2015'
# if not applicable -> leave empty ''
# adds 3 columns to metadata: S.Score, G2M.Score, and Phase
cell_cycle:
    s_phase_genes: 'tirosh2015'
    g2m_phase_genes: 'tirosh2015'

# provide paths to gene lists in plain .txt to perform scoring using https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/addmodulescore
module_gene_lists:
    Cytokine_genes: "/path/to/Cytokine_genes.txt"


##### CORRECTION #####
# performed on filtered raw data (includes normalization) and stores the corrected data in assay="SCT", slot="scale.data" of the Seurat object

# need to be variables in metadata post cell scoring (ie normalization step)
# example: ["mitoPercent"]
variables_to_regress: []

##### VISUALIZATION #####
# of metadata (after each step) and expression data after normalization (slot="data") and correction (slot="scale.data"), respectively
# ridge plots & violin plots for other modalities are only generated after normalization (using slot="data")
# dot plots: only uses data from slot="data" (-> only generated for step NORMALIZED), averages the values, and then passes them to scale. These are then Min-Maxed based on the col.min and col.max parameter values.
# heatmaps: always use data from slot="scale.data"

# categorical metadata variables to group cells in plots eg condition
vis_categories: ['batch']

# provide paths to gene lists in plain .txt to plot expression individually (Ridge plots, Violin plots) and grouped (eg Heatmap, Dot plots)
vis_gene_lists:
    Cytokine_genes: "/path/to/Cytokine_genes.txt"

# features per modality (if not applicable, leave empty []), which expression should be plotted, ['all'] plots every feature
